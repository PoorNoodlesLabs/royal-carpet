                  - It is best to allow a drying time of six to eight hours
                  before you resume regular traffic on your carpet. Light
                  traffic with clean socks or booties (we provide) is okay, but
                  walking from damp carpet to a hard surface is SLIPPERY, so you
                  must be very cautious. For optimal drying times, the
                  temperature in the house should be between 70-72, with the air
                  moving via fans, ceiling fans, etc.

                  - You can never vacuum too much! Although carpet cleaning will
                  remove the vast majority of soil and allergens from your
                  carpet, it definitely doesn't hurt to do a preliminary
                  once-over with your vacuum. Vacuuming before we arrive allows
                  the steam cleaning process to work even more effectively,
                  because an entire top layer of dust, dirt, hair, and other
                  debris has already been removed. This allows the carpet
                  cleaning pre-spray solution process to extract deeper levels
                  of soil, and that means you get a deeper clean.

              <ul>

                  - Carpet can get pretty filthy pretty quickly, especially if
                  there are pets, kids, or lots of foot traffic involved.
                  Although you can rent or buy your own carpet cleaning machine,
                  they're not as powerful nor as effective as our truck mounted
                  machine. Our water reaches 250 degrees, so it not only cleans,
                  it sanitizes. Some off-the-shelf cleaners have a high pH,
                  which can leave a residue behind or have other negative
                  results. Hiring a professional carpet cleaner who has the
                  professional-grade equipment, cleaning solutions, and
                  deodorizers on hand means your carpet gets cleaned deeper and
                  dries faster.

                  whole process shouldn't take longer than 3 hours or so. Once
                  the cleaning is done, however, it can take up to 4-6 hours for
                  carpets to dry completely, depending on airflow, air

                  - Deodorizer uses enzymes to neutralize and remove odors such
                  as vomit and pet waste. Unfortunately if the odor source has
                  reached the backing or padding complete removal of the odor
                  cannot be guaranteed. Additional Treatments are available for
                  an additional charge. Carpet protection shields each fiber of
                  the carpet allowing the carpet to resist dirt, spills, and
                  stains. This protection should allow you to keep your carpet
                  looking cleaner longer.

                  - This describes a more aggressive cleaning process that works
                  on the acid side of the pH scale removing soils and stains on
                  grout, tile and stone that have been neglected for years or
                  has had color sealant applied to the grout. The acid cleaner
                  actually removes a very thin layer of grout, taking with it
                  hard water deposits, soap scum and efflorescence. Using this
                  process, requires cleaning first with an alkali cleanser, then
                  using the acid cleanser, cleaning again with the alkali
                  cleanser and rinsing with a neutralizer to bring your tile &
                  grout back to a neutral pH. Restorative cleaning is amazing,
                  but cannot be guaranteed to remove all stains or color sealant
                  (although we give it our best attempt).
